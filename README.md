# Automated Electrical Substation Layout Generator

## Overview

This project is a Python-based automation tool developed to generate electrical substation equipment layouts automatically in DXF format.

The system places major substation equipment such as transformers, HT panels, LT panels, DG sets, ancillary rooms, and access shutters while following predefined engineering spacing and clearance rules.

Instead of manually drafting layouts in AutoCAD, the user provides equipment configuration and dimensions, and the program generates a complete preliminary layout automatically.

---

## Sample Output

The generated layout includes:

- DG Sets
- HT Panel
- Transformers
- Perforated Rolling Shutters
- UPS & Battery Room
- SCADA Room
- Maintenance & Control Room
- Toilet
- RMU Panel Room
- Grid Layout
- Room Boundary
- AutoCAD-ready DXF Drawing

---

## Features

### Equipment Placement

Automatically places:

- Transformers
- HT Panels
- RMU Panels
- DG Sets
- LT Panels
- APFC Panels
- DG Synchronizing Panels
- RTCC Panels
- Auxiliary Equipment

while maintaining spacing and clearance requirements.

---

### Ancillary Room Generation

Automatically generates and positions:

- UPS & Battery Room
- SCADA Room
- Maintenance & Control Room
- Toilet
- RMU Panel Room

based on reference project dimensions.

---

### Transformer Bay Access Planning

Generates:

- Transformer Bays
- Perforated Rolling Shutters

to provide access for transformer installation and replacement.

---

### DXF Generation

Produces AutoCAD-compatible DXF drawings including:

- Equipment outlines
- Room boundaries
- Equipment labels
- Dimension annotations
- Grid system
- North arrow
- Title block

---

### Dynamic Layout Sizing

The layout adjusts automatically based on:

- Number of transformers
- Number of DG sets
- Panel dimensions
- Ancillary room dimensions
- Clearance requirements

---

## Layout Philosophy

The current layout follows:

```text
DG SETS

HT / LT PANELS

ANCILLARY ROOMS

TRANSFORMERS

PERFORATED ROLLING SHUTTERS

MAIN ENTRANCE
```

This arrangement ensures:

- Clear equipment segregation
- Accessible transformer replacement path
- Better utilization of floor space
- Consistent room positioning
